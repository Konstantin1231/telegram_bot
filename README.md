# BabayanBot: A Telegram Bot for Mimicking Our Friend's Classic Moves

Welcome to the source code repository for BabayanBot, the Telegram bot designed not just for fun but to embody the essence of our friend Babayan's notorious inactivity and tendency to ignore us. This bot is a playful venture into the world of generative AI, aiming to mimic Babayan's behavior in a humorous and engaging manner.

## Project Overview

BabayanBot is a project born out of the desire to poke fun at our friend Babayan's often elusive and inactive nature. Using advanced generative AI technologies, including the integration of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, the bot aims to replicate Babayan's responses (or lack thereof) to our messages, keeping the spirit of our interactions alive and kicking.

### Features

- **Mimic Babayan's Behavior:** Through carefully designed algorithms, BabayanBot analyzes incoming messages and generates responses that mirror Babayan's typical reaction patterns, including ignoring messages, sending late replies, and more.
- **RAG Integration for Memory Recall:** To ensure the bot's responses are not just random but also reflect Babayan's personality and past interactions, we've incorporated a RAG model. This model helps the bot recall previous interactions or facts related to Babayan, making the conversations feel more authentic.
- **Contribute to Babayan's Memory:** Anyone can contribute to or tweak Babayan's memory bank to enhance the bot's responses. Visit our dedicated Hugging Face space at [Babayan's Data](https://huggingface.co/spaces/koq1231/Babayan_data) to contribute.
